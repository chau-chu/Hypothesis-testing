# Hypothesis-testing

(1) t-test: I use matrix, ttest and frmttable commands to investigate differences between TAXED and UNTAXED firms over means of several aspects (e.g., access to road and rail, exporting behavior, and some financial factors of physical capital, total assets, total debts, production output and sales)
